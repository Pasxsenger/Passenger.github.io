Companies need to tell customers about their products. Advertisements inform us about the choice we have. Without advertising we would have less choice. Advertising is a creative industry that employs many people. Without advertising there would be higher unemployment. Advertising is a form of modern art. Negatives of Advertising: Advertising may manipulate people’s decision. It aims to persuade people that buying a product will make them happier. Advertises focus on selling a brand image. They use glamorous, successful people.(celebrities) We now live in a consumer culture.(society) We are persuaded to follow the latest trends. We are encouraged to associate certain brands with a higher status. Advertisers often aim their marketing at children. Children can easily be influenced by advertisements. Children put pressure on parents to buy them things. Sentences:1.在家工作者应该是那些喜欢弹性工作制的人。 Home workers are supposed to be those who like flexible work schedule. 2.一般来说，年轻人有高尚的理想，会为了精神追求而努力奋斗。 Generally, the youth have noble ambitions, and they will strive for spiritual pursuit. 3.认为自己职业前景黯淡的员工容易萌生跳槽的念头。 Workers who think their career prospects are bleak are prone to having the idea of job-hopping. 4.负担一个大家庭的人不会轻易跳槽，因为他们需要一份稳定的收入。 Breadwinners who raise a big family are not prone to jumping ship, because they need a stable income. 5.与工作压力相关的问题包括更多的家庭纠纷和效率与生产力低下。 Issues related to working stress include more family/domestic disputes and lower productivity and efficiency. 6.只有精英分子才有自信在跳槽之后得到升职和高薪。 Only elites have confidence in getting promoted and higher salary after job-hopping. Practice:Getting a job in which you work with other people is better than getting a job in which you have to work alone. There are many things to consider in terms of work pattern. Different people have different ideas about whether or not work with other people. While some people like to work alone. Others prefer to work with colleagues. Personally, I believe it is better for employees to work with each other, because employees who work with others can hone their interpersonal skills, and the work mode could encourage the competition. Meanwhile, collaboration may inspire people’s creativity. Firstly, it is universally acknowledged that working with others can improve employees’ communication skills. At work, workers learn how to communicate with colleagues, bosses and customers. For example, what a programmer has to deal with is not only computer programs, but also figuring out what their partners are thinking, which means that workers must communicate and negotiate with colleagues frequently. Moreover, colleagues that workers cooperate with are their rivals as well. As we all know, cooperation and competition are the eternal themes of human growth. Working with one another creates competitive atmosphere and environment, so that employees can gain knowledge from people who are more excellent than themselves. What’s more, the stress that competition brings may stimulate their passion for work. Last but not least, teamwork definitely inspires people’s creativity. According to research, thirty years ago, only ten percent of Noble Prize winners worked in a team. Nowadays, the proportion of achievements achieved by teamwork has reached sixty percent. As the saying goes that two heads are better than one. The collision of people’s ideas always has the effects beyond the expectation. In conclusion, I hold an opinion that working alone may avoid amounts of troubles, but it is far from being an efficient work mode. Instead, working with other people is the better way not only to encourage the productivity but to make workers enjoy teamwork as well. That why we should undoubtedly work with each other.]]></content>

Practice:Technology has made people’s lives simpler, rather than more complicated. When thinking about the issue that how has technology changed our lives, different people will have different ideas. While some people may believe technology has made people’s lives more complicated, I think that it enables people to live more simply. Because technology can help boost efficiency. Firstly, in terms of work and study, people gain easier access to information than before. For example, compared to the thick and heavy printed books in the past, we can find what we want on the Internet with the click of a mouse. Besides, labor-saving machinery plays an important role as well. Nowadays, massive amounts of work can be finished by computer programs, such as keeping bank accounts. As for me, I sometimes write a computer program to do some complicated calculations. Moreover, when it comes to the transportation, the ever-changing technology is even more impressive. Thanks to the advent of high-speed rail technology, we used to travel a day on a traditional train that could take a few hours. Taking myself as an example, when my parents drove me from home to the university in another city, it took almost a whole day. But after the high-speed line from home to my university being constructed, I can reunite with my family in about seven hours. Meanwhile, with the advances in airline, long-distance travel becomes more convenient. During the summer vacation, I traveled to Nanjing. From the time the plane took off to the time it landed, I even did not finish a bag of chips. In conclusion, I would like to say that technology has played a significant role in making people’s life much simpler. And It is undeniable that we can enjoy an efficient life with technology. This is why I support this viewpoint.]]></content>

Whether or not the most effective way for the government to conserve energy is to increase the price of gasoline and electricity is an often-debated topic. While some people may feel that the authority should raise the price thus reducing people’s use of energy, I do not believe that this is the most effective way. A world where energy use is strictly restricted cannot guarantee people’s well-being, and human development would be retarded. I believe that the price should be reasonably set and as stable as possible instead of being recklessly increased. Firstly, due to the increasing price of gasoline and electricity, the cost of living will correspondingly rise, which causes social problems. For instance, commuters, who choose public transport over driving owing to the increasing price of gasoline, may get exhausted from a longer commuting time than before. Then they will lack energy and patience in their work, which means their productivity may suffer. Lower productivity can hardly win them an opportunity to get promoted and decently paid. Without enough well-being, people tend to complain about the government. Moreover, people who have high income or profit from energy are indifferent to high prices. For example, what energy related industries will do when face the increasing price of gasoline and electricity is to correspondingly raise the price of products, or lower the quality to reduce the cost. After all, the extra cost is ultimately borne by consumers. Besides, industrial output will decrease more or less. Once supply is less than demand, the public interest will be influenced by soaring prices. Capitalists, by contrast, benefit from it. In conclusion, I hold an opinion that increasing the price of energy is far from being the best way to conserve energy. Rather than just focusing on raising prices, improving energy efficiency is a better idea. In this case, not only can people’s well-being be guaranteed, but also the problem of energy waste and environmental contamination will be significantly reduced.]]></content>

Practice：Which one of the reason is most important in helping students to study in colleges and universities? A. Having access to the university tutors who can provide individual instruction for the students who have difficulty in study. B. Having the help and encouragement from the family and friends. C. Having excellent teachers in high-school who can help the students before the university. Use you OWN words to illustrate your point. Don’t use your memorized examples.(300 words) During the university, students are supposed to enrich their knowledge constantly and be successful in their academic field. However, students are less likely to achieve rounded development on their own. This is the reason why undergraduates need others’ help. When thinking about who plays the most important role in helping students to study in universities, different people have different ideas. While some people may believe it is family and friends, and some consider it is high-school teachers, I think it is university tutors who is key. Firstly, university tutors are helpful in professional academic research. When students have difficulty in study, tutors can provide individual instruction. Since they have already studied this field for a long time. As for me, I major in computer science. When I have problems with programming, my tutor always proposes more accurate and comprehensible solutions patiently than mine. And I can learn programming thinking pattern from her suggestions. Thanks to her, I am familiar with programming and find it interesting now. Furthermore, tutors can broaden students’ professional horizon. Tutors may teach basic knowledge in the major, but what they are digging into is probably the most advanced in the field. Knowing any of those will be valuable for students. For example, I used to help my tutor who teaches machine learning with some additional jobs in his digital vein comparison project based on neutral network. My team members and I compared more than 70,000 digital vein images with our own naked eye. This seemingly boring task made me understand the boredom behind scientific research, so that I can be better prepared for it in the future. In conclusion, I really believe university tutors have a vital role to play in terms of helping us succeed in our university. With tutors help, students can not only acquire the knowledge which they are required to study at the moment, but also extend their vision to a further place in the professional field. This is why I support having access to the university tutors instead of seeking help from family, friends or high-school teachers.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[As an emergency rescue team leader of a city, you are given a special map of your country. The map shows several scattered cities connected by some roads. Amount of rescue teams in each city and the length of each road between any pair of cities are marked on the map. When there is an emergency call to you from some other city, your job is to lead your men to the place as quickly as possible, and at the mean time, call up as many hands on the way as possible. Input Specification:Each input file contains one test case. For each test case, the first line contains 4 positive integers: N (≤500) - the number of cities (and the cities are numbered from 0 to N−1), M - the number of roads, C1 and C2 - the cities that you are currently in and that you must save, respectively. The next line contains N integers, where the i-th integer is the number of rescue teams in the i-th city. Then M lines follow, each describes a road with three integers c1, c2 and L, which are the pair of cities connected by a road and the length of that road, respectively. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one path from C1 to C2. Output Specification:For each test case, print in one line two numbers: the number of different shortest paths between C1 and C2, and the maximum amount of rescue teams you can possibly gather. All the numbers in a line must be separated by exactly one space, and there is no extra space allowed at the end of a line.

    <title><![CDATA[Python十大装B语法]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F11%2F04%2FPython%E5%8D%81%E5%A4%A7%E8%A3%85B%E8%AF%AD%E6%B3%95%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Python 是一种代表简单思想的语言，其语法相对简单，很容易上手。不过，如果就此小视 Python 语法的精妙和深邃，那就大错特错了。本文精心筛选了最能展现 Python 语法之精妙的十个知识点，并附上详细的实例代码。如能在实战中融会贯通、灵活使用，必将使代码更为精炼、高效，同时也会极大提升代码B格，使之看上去更老练，读起来更优雅。1.for-else什么？不是 if 和 else 才是原配吗？No，你可能不知道，else 是个脚踩两只船的家伙，for 和 else 也是一对，而且是合法的。十大装B语法，for-else 绝对算得上南无湾！不信，请看： 12345678910&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in [1,2,3,4]: print(i)else: print(i, '我是else')12344 我是else 如果在 for 和 else 之间（循环体内）有第三者 if 插足，也不会影响 for 和 else 的关系。因为 for 的级别比 if 高，else 又是一个攀附权贵的家伙，根本不在乎是否有 if，以及是否执行了满足 if 条件的语句。else 的眼里只有 for，只要 for 顺利执行完毕，else 就会屁颠儿屁颠儿地跑一遍： 123456789&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in [1,2,3,4]: if i &gt; 2: print(i)else: print(i, '我是else')344 我是else 那么，如何拆散 for 和 else 这对冤家呢？只有当 for 循环被 break 语句中断之后，才会跳过 else 语句： 12345678&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in [1,2,3,4]: if i&gt;2: print(i) breakelse: print(i, '我是else')3 2.一颗星()和两颗星(*)有没有发现，星(*)真是一个神奇的符号！想一想，没有它，C语言还有啥好玩的？同样，因为有它，Python 才会如此的仪态万方、风姿绰约、楚楚动人！Python 函数支持默认参数和可变参数，一颗星表示不限数量的单值参数，两颗星表示不限数量的键值对参数。 我们还是举例说明吧：设计一个函数，返回多个输入数值的和。我们固然可以把这些输入数值做成一个list传给函数，但这个方法，远没有使用一颗星的可变参数来得优雅： 12345678&gt;&gt;&gt; def multi_sum(*args): s = 0 for item in args: s += item return s&gt;&gt;&gt; multi_sum(3,4,5)12 Python 函数允许同时全部或部分使用固定参数、默认参数、单值（一颗星）可变参数、键值对（两颗星）可变参数，使用时必须按照前述顺序书写。 123456789&gt;&gt;&gt; def do_something(name, age, gender='男', *args, **kwds): print('姓名：%s，年龄：%d，性别：%s'%(name, age, gender)) print(args) print(kwds)&gt;&gt;&gt; do_something('xufive', 50, '男', 175, 75, math=99, english=90)姓名：xufive，年龄：50，性别：男(175, 75)&#123;'math': 99, 'english': 90&#125; 3.三元表达式熟悉 C/C++ 的程序员，初上手 python 时，一定会怀念经典的三元操作符，因为想表达同样的思想，用python 写起来似乎更麻烦。比如： 1234567&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 5&gt;&gt;&gt; if y &lt; 0: print('y是一个负数')else: print('y是一个非负数')y是一个非负数 其实，python 是支持三元表达式的，只是稍微怪异了一点，类似于我们山东人讲话。比如，山东人最喜欢用倒装句：打球去吧，要是不下雨的话；下雨，咱就去自习室。翻译成三元表达式就是： 1打球去吧 if 不下雨 else 去自习室 来看看三元表达式具体的使用： 123&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 5&gt;&gt;&gt; print('y是一个负数' if y &lt; 0 else 'y是一个非负数')y是一个非负数 python 的三元表达式也可以用来赋值： 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 5&gt;&gt;&gt; x = -1 if y &lt; 0 else 1&gt;&gt;&gt; x1 4.with-aswith 这个词儿，英文里面不难翻译，但在 Python 语法中怎么翻译，我还真想不出来，大致上是一种上下文管理协议。作为初学者，不用关注 with 的各种方法以及机制如何，只需要了解它的应用场景就可以了。with 语句适合一些事先需要准备，事后需要处理的任务，比如，文件操作，需要先打开文件，操作完成后需要关闭文件。如果不使用with，文件操作通常得这样： 12345fp = open(r"D:\CSDN\Column\temp\mpmap.py", 'r')try: contents = fp.readlines()finally: fp.close() 如果使用 with - as，那就优雅多了： 12&gt;&gt;&gt; with open(r"D:\CSDN\Column\temp\mpmap.py", 'r') as fp: contents = fp.readlines() 5.列表推导式在各种稀奇古怪的语法中，列表推导式的使用频率应该时最高的，对于代码的简化效果也非常明显。比如，求列表各元素的平方，通常应该这样写（当然也有其他写法，比如使用map函数）： 1234567&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; result = list()&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in a: result.append(i*i)&gt;&gt;&gt; result[1, 4, 9, 16, 25] 如果使用列表推导式，看起来就舒服多了： 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; result = [i*i for i in a]&gt;&gt;&gt; result[1, 4, 9, 16, 25] 事实上，推导式不仅支持列表，也支持字典、集合、元组等对象。有一篇博文《一行 Python 代码能实现什么丧心病狂的功能？》，里面的例子，都是列表推导式实现的。 6.列表索引的各种骚操作Python 引入负整数作为数组的索引，这绝对是喜大普奔之举。想想看，在C/C++中，想要数组最后一个元素，得先取得数组长度，减一之后做索引，严重影响了思维的连贯性。Python语言之所以获得成功，我个人觉得，在诸多因素里面，列表操作的便捷性是不容忽视的一点。请看： 123456789101112131415161718192021&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2:4][2, 3]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[3:][3, 4, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1:][1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:][0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[::2][0, 2, 4]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1::2][1, 3, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-1]5&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-2]4&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1:-1][1, 2, 3, 4]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[::-1][5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] 如果说，这些你都很熟悉，也经常用，那么接下来这个用法，你一定会感觉很神奇： 12345678&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; b = ['a', 'b']&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2:2] = b&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0, 1, 'a', 'b', 2, 3, 4, 5]&gt;&gt;&gt; a[3:6] = b&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0, 1, 'a', 'a', 'b', 4, 5] 7.lambda函数lambda 听起来很高大上，其实就是匿名函数（了解js的同学一定很熟悉匿名函数）。匿名函数的应用场景是什么呢？就是仅在定义匿名函数的地方使用这个函数，其他地方用不到，所以就不需要给它取个阿猫阿狗之类的名字了。下面是一个求和的匿名函数，输入参数有两个，x和y，函数体就是x+y，省略了return关键字。 123&gt;&gt;&gt; lambda x,y: x+y&lt;function &lt;lambda&gt; at 0x000001B2DE5BD598&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (lambda x,y: x+y)(3,4) # 因为匿名函数没有名字，使用的时候要用括号把它包起来 匿名函数一般不会单独使用，而是配合其他方法，为其他方法提供内置的算法或判断条件。比如，使用排序函数sorted对多维数组或者字典排序时，就可以指定排序规则。 12345&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [&#123;'name':'B', 'age':50&#125;, &#123;'name':'A', 'age':30&#125;, &#123;'name':'C', 'age':40&#125;]&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(a, key=lambda x:x['name']) # 按姓名排序[&#123;'name': 'A', 'age': 30&#125;, &#123;'name': 'B', 'age': 50&#125;, &#123;'name': 'C', 'age': 40&#125;]&gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(a, key=lambda x:x['age']) # 按年龄排序[&#123;'name': 'A', 'age': 30&#125;, &#123;'name': 'C', 'age': 40&#125;, &#123;'name': 'B', 'age': 50&#125;] 再举一个数组元素求平方的例子，这次用map函数： 12345&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3]&gt;&gt;&gt; for item in map(lambda x:x*x, a): print(item, end=', ')1, 4, 9, 8.yield以及生成器和迭代器要理解 yield，得先了解 generator（生成器）。要了解generator，得先知道 iterator（迭代器）。哈哈哈，绕晕了吧？算了，我还是说白话吧。 话说py2时代，range()返回的是list，但如果range(10000000)的话，会消耗大量内存资源，所以，py2又搞了一个xrange()来解决这个问题。py3则只保留了xrange()，但写作range()。xrange()返回的就是一个迭代器，它可以像list那样被遍历，但又不占用多少内存。generator（生成器）是一种特殊的迭代器，只能被遍历一次，遍历结束，就自动消失了。总之，不管是迭代器还是生成器，都是为了避免使用list，从而节省内存。那么，如何得到迭代器和生成器呢？ python内置了迭代函数 iter，用于生成迭代器，用法如下： 12345678&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1,2,3]&gt;&gt;&gt; a_iter = iter(a)&gt;&gt;&gt; a_iter&lt;list_iterator object at 0x000001B2DE434BA8&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in a_iter: print(i, end=', ')1, 2, 3, yield 则是用于构造生成器的。比如，我们要写一个函数，返回从0到某正整数的所有整数的平方，传统的代码写法是这样的： 12345678&gt;&gt;&gt; def get_square(n): result = list() for i in range(n): result.append(pow(i,2)) return result&gt;&gt;&gt; print(get_square(5))[0, 1, 4, 9, 16] 但是如果计算1亿以内的所有整数的平方，这个函数的内存开销会非常大，这是 yield 就可以大显身手了： 1234567891011&gt;&gt;&gt; def get_square(n): for i in range(n): yield(pow(i,2))&gt;&gt;&gt; a = get_square(5)&gt;&gt;&gt; a&lt;generator object get_square at 0x000001B2DE5CACF0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in a: print(i, end=', ')0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 如果再次遍历，则不会有输出了。 9.装饰器刚弄明白迭代器和生成器，这又来个装饰器，Python 咋这么多器呢？的确，Python 为我们提供了很多的武器，装饰器就是最有力的武器之一。装饰器很强大，我在这里尝试从需求的角度，用一个简单的例子，说明装饰器的使用方法和制造工艺。 假如我们需要定义很多个函数，在每个函数运行的时候要显示这个函数的运行时长，解决方案有很多。比如，可以在调用每个函数之前读一下时间戳，每个函数运行结束后再读一下时间戳，求差即可；也可以在每个函数体内的开始和结束位置上读时间戳，最后求差。不过，这两个方法，都没有使用装饰器那么简单、优雅。下面的例子，很好地展示了这一点。 1234567891011121314151617181920&gt;&gt;&gt; import time&gt;&gt;&gt; def timer(func): def wrapper(*args,**kwds): t0 = time.time() func(*args,**kwds) t1 = time.time() print('耗时%0.3f'%(t1-t0,)) return wrapper&gt;&gt;&gt; @timerdef do_something(delay): print('函数do_something开始') time.sleep(delay) print('函数do_something结束')&gt;&gt;&gt; do_something(3)函数do_something开始函数do_something结束耗时3.077 timer() 是我们定义的装饰器函数，使用@把它附加在任何一个函数（比如do_something）定义之前，就等于把新定义的函数，当成了装饰器函数的输入参数。运行 do_something() 函数，可以理解为执行了timer(do_something) 。细节虽然复杂，不过这么理解不会偏差太大，且更易于把握装饰器的制造和使用。 10.巧用断言assert所谓断言，就是声明表达式的布尔值必须为真的判定，否则将触发 AssertionError 异常。严格来讲，assert是调试手段，不宜使用在生产环境中，但这不影响我们用断言来实现一些特定功能，比如，输入参数的格式、类型验证等。 1234567891011121314151617181920&gt;&gt;&gt; def i_want_to_sleep(delay): assert(isinstance(delay, (int,float))), '函数参数必须为整数或浮点数' print('开始睡觉') time.sleep(delay) print('睡醒了')&gt;&gt;&gt; i_want_to_sleep(1.1)开始睡觉睡醒了&gt;&gt;&gt; i_want_to_sleep(2)开始睡觉睡醒了&gt;&gt;&gt; i_want_to_sleep('2')Traceback (most recent call last): File "&lt;pyshell#247&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt; i_want_to_sleep('2') File "&lt;pyshell#244&gt;", line 2, in i_want_to_sleep assert(isinstance(delay, (int,float))), '函数参数必须为整数或浮点数'AssertionError: 函数参数必须为整数或浮点数]]></content>
